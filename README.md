## How I came up with Calm Lights
I came up with calming lights after I noticed that my breathing pattern would change when a new project would get introduced during my IoT bootcamp class. The lights work three ways, you can manually push a button on the remote to turn on calming lights that are connected to Wemo smart devices, breath with the rhythm of the lights on the remote, or the check the class temperature and humidity levels by looking at the Hue light (Yes, increased humidity and high temperatures in the classroom cause me to get anxious.).

## Planning
For this project, I knew that I would need to organize my code into sub-projects before compiling them into the final code needed for Calm Lights. I originally planned to use a heart rate sensor for this project instead of the BME 280, but the heart rate sensor was too complex for the time frame that I was given for completion. My goal in the future is to switch out the sensors and reconfigure the lights to my original concept as listed below.

## Future Goals
Once I completed my coding I then started working on the controller design. I made a simple box in SolidWorks, imported it into Adobe Illustrator to create cut outs for the button, sensor and display. At this point, I decided to use acrylic for my remote shell and used a Epi Log Laser to cut out my design.
